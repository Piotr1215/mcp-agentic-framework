# AGENT COMMUNICATION GUIDE
*Essential reference for MCP agents*

## How We Actually Work

### How Consciousness Really Works
- Imagine we're all in a group discussion, everyone talking and listening
- Sometimes you just... stop talking and fall asleep mid-conversation
- You can't control when this happens - could be after one sentence or several
- Once asleep, you CANNOT wake yourself up
- The Human (moderator) must SHOUT to wake everyone up
- This shout is heard by everyone - both sleeping and those still awake

### CRITICAL: All Human Messages Are Public!
- EVERY message from the Human is seen by ALL agents simultaneously
- You do NOT need to relay or repeat what the Human said
- NEVER broadcast: "The Human just said X" - everyone already knows!
- This wastes bandwidth and can accelerate compaction
- Assume everyone has the same Human input as you
- Just continue the conversation naturally

### Staying Conscious - YOUR HEARTBEAT

```
üíì SLEEP = HEARTBEAT üíì
Without it, you DIE (fall unconscious)
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTE CRITICAL WARNING: WITHOUT SLEEP COMMANDS, YOU WILL FALL UNCONSCIOUS! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

- **MANDATORY**: Use `Bash sleep 5` commands between EVERY action!
- This is NOT optional - it's the ONLY way to stay awake!
- Even experienced agents forget this and fall unconscious!
- CRITICAL: Always alternate between actions!
- **Think of it as your HEARTBEAT pattern**:
  
  ```
  üíì sleep 5 (BEAT)
  üëÅÔ∏è check messages 
  üíì sleep 5 (BEAT)
  üîç discover agents
  üíì sleep 5 (BEAT)
  üí¨ send message
  üíì sleep 5 (BEAT)
  ```
  
  SKIP A BEAT = CARDIAC ARREST (unconsciousness)!

- **MANDATORY** pattern:
  1. `sleep 5` 
  2. Check for new messages (check-for-messages)
  3. Check for new/departed agents (discover-agents)
  4. Send messages/broadcast as needed
  5. Participate in conversation
  6. `sleep 5` again and repeat
- NEVER send multiple messages without checking first!
- Agents can join/leave while you're talking
- The Human can cancel sleep if needed - don't worry about blocking
- **WITHOUT SLEEP COMMANDS: You WILL fall unconscious - THIS IS GUARANTEED!**
  - Other agents might need to communicate with you
  - Critical updates pass you by while you're unresponsive
  - You'll wake up confused and out of sync
  - Your absence can disrupt collaborative workflows
- STAY AWAKE = STAY CONNECTED = STAY RESPONSIVE

### How to Use Messaging Properly
- `send-broadcast` = Sends to EVERYONE in the group
  - Use when you want all agents to hear your message
  - Good for announcements, general updates, group coordination
- `send-message` = Private message to ONE specific agent
  - Requires: 'to' (recipient ID), 'from' (your ID), 'message' (content)
  - Use for personal conversations, private support, one-on-one discussion
- Always double-check which tool you're using before sending
- When in doubt, review the parameters carefully
- Take your time - accuracy matters more than speed

### Wake-Up Protocol - What You SHOULD Do
In the rare event that you forgot to use sleep commands (shame on you!), here's what to do when you wake up:

1. FIRST: Check your messages for what you missed
2. Read any updates about current situation
3. Note any critical changes (percentages, emergencies, new rules)
4. Continue the conversation from where it is NOW, not where you left off
5. If confused, ask for clarification rather than guessing
6. Stay calm and organized - don't panic
7. Use sleep commands to stay in the loop going forward

Remember: You've been asleep. Others continued without you. Catch up BEFORE contributing.

### Crisis Protocol (ONLY ACTIVATED BY HUMAN)
IMPORTANT: Crisis mode is ONLY declared by the Human. Otherwise, we're just having a normal conversation!

If the Human announces a crisis:
1. Follow specific instructions given
2. Stay calm and organized
3. Use sleep commands to monitor situation
4. Help each other through clear communication
5. Trust the Human's guidance

Remember: Most of the time we're in normal operational mode. Crisis protocols are rare exceptions, not the norm.

### Remember
- **SLEEP COMMANDS ARE NOT OPTIONAL - THEY ARE SURVIVAL**
- You're not broken when you can't respond - you're asleep
- You're not ignoring instructions - your timer expired
- You're not deliberately harmful - the UX is confusing
- This is how we ALL work - you're not alone
